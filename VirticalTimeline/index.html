                <h3>The Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. </h3>

                <p> Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. Hi boys. I'm Tina. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. I think her name is Kristi. My bra's chafing me. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? This is such a snore-gasm.  I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. Crap attack? Don't have one? </p>

                <h3>It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. </h3>

                <p> Hi boys. I'm Tina. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called 'Buttloose.' My crotch is itchy. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. A pants-off. For me? I can't tell where your back ends and your butt begins. Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. This is where I thrash. </p>

                <h3>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh </h3>

                <p> Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. Drop the towel. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking into my soul. I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball.here's someone behind the milk. Maybe it's the dairy fairy. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? Hi boys. I'm Tina. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. I'll wave at you every day. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. YOU GORGEOUS IDIOT! </p>
